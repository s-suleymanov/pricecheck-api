      PriceCheck designs, builds, and operates open-source tools that make fair pricing possible for everyone. We offer a shopping assistant, browser extension, dashboard, and research workspaces that track prices across major retailers in real time. Our products help people compare the exact same item across stores, understand true price history, and decide when a deal is actually worth it.
