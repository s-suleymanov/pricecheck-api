      <h1>State of PriceCheck: Update 0.8.7</h1>
      <p class="muted">By Sam Lyman • Human-Written • December 26, 2025</p>
      <p>The newest update to PriceCheck is now live! This update includes a new dashboard, improved search functionality, and better support for product variants. The next update will focus more on PriceCheck Insights and support features which I plan to release soon. I will talk more about future updates in a separate post.</p>
      <p>Before this update, I had two main databases: one for Amazon products and another for all other products. However, I realized that it was very inefficient and time-consuming as it required maintaining separate logic for each database. Now, I have a unified database that handles all products, making the system more efficient and easier to maintain. Another issue I encountered was the complexity of managing multiple Amazon products (ASIN keys) for one product. In other words, different sellers on Amazon were selling the same exact product. To fix this, I added a new database called Catalog and it allows me to manage all variants of a product in one place.</p>
      <p>Some quality of life changes were also added, including making the Coverage Snapshot more dynamic and responsive. Cross offers now supports notes and offer details while the product information provides useful details including product category, brand and images. Additional bug fixes have been implemented to improve overall performance and stability, especially for PriceCheck Intelligence and PriceMatch. I will continue monitoring the system for any issues.</p>
      <p>The extension saw many useful features added including notes, a dynamic footer that allows users to easily navigate between the website and the extension, and improved response times. Additional stores and their data have been added including in the e-scooter category (Solo Performance, Radical Adventures, etc.) I am planning on adding support features and providing even more store coverage in the next update. However, I am still working on improving the overall user experience and performance of PriceCheck in its current form. I know many products are still missing from PriceCheck and I am working overtime to ensure our scrappers can collect as many products as possible.</p>
      <p>Thank you for supporting PriceCheck as I navigate database changes, bug fixes, feature enhancements and improvements. I know many product weren't available during this period and I am working overtime to ensure that PriceCheck remains a valuable tool for all users. It has been a difficult journey getting here, but I am committed to continuing to improve PriceCheck for everyone. Happy New Year!</p>
