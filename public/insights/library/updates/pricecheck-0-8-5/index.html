      <h1>PriceCheck 0.8.5 Update</h1>
      <p class="muted">By Samir Leyman • Hybrid • Nov 14, 2025</p>
      <p>You are getting a cleaner, faster PriceCheck with version 0.8.5, and the goal is simple: help you buy the exact item for less without extra work. When you paste a link or type an ID, the Dashboard now locks onto the precise model so the comparison lines up the same product across Amazon, Target, Walmart, and Best Buy. You avoid lookalikes and bundle traps, and the title reads the way you expect, with the brand shown once and the model shown clearly.</p>
      <p>Finding the best deal takes fewer clicks. The cross-store view highlights the real options and lets you open either the exact captured listing or the main product page, so you can choose what you prefer. If you just want the lowest price fast, you can copy the cheapest working link in one click and go straight to checkout.</p>
      <p>Price matching is easier too. The PriceMatch helper writes a ready-to-send message that includes the lower price, a link to the offer, and the product IDs a retailer asks for. You do not need to assemble evidence or worry about formatting, since the details are already filled in.</p>
      <p>Coverage Snapshot now reflects value rather than noise. Instead of splitting percentages evenly by store or showing distracting numbers, the chart quietly weights each store by how competitive its price is right now. Your eyes go to the winner first, which makes the decision feel obvious rather than confusing.</p>
      <p>When a product line has several versions, you can switch variants from a simple dropdown and stay on the same comparison page. That means you can check colors or capacities without starting over, and the pricing view updates to the exact choice you picked. You spend less time hunting and more time deciding.</p>
      <p>Behind the scenes we keep the page fresh so you do not have to. The Observation Log records price changes with exact timestamps from our servers and feeds the comparison you see. The Overview page shows a small activity card with how many unique items we observed and how many price events we processed in the last day, which is a simple way to confirm that the price comparison data you rely on is active today.</p>
      <p>Everything in 0.8.5 aims to remove friction. You compare real prices across major retailers, you avoid wrong variants, you grab the best link quickly, and you get a clear path to a price match when it helps. If you are new to PriceCheck, install the extension and paste any Amazon, Target, Walmart, or Best Buy link into the Dashboard to see a clean comparison. If you already use PriceCheck, try a product you care about and watch the right result snap into place.</p>
