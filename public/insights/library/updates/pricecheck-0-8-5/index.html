      <h1>PriceCheck 0.8.5 Update</h1>
      <p class="muted">By Sam Leyman • Hybrid • Nov 14, 2025</p>
      <p>
        The purpose of the 0.8.5 update is to increase accuracy, improve usability, and make PriceCheck feel more reliable every time you look up a product. The long term goal is simple: when you care about a specific item, you should be able to trust that PriceCheck is lining up the right product, with live prices, across the major stores, without extra work on your side. This release tightens how we store and serve data for each arm of the product so that the numbers, the context, and the live comparison all stay in sync.      
      </p>
      <p>
        On the Research side, 0.8.5 moves everything onto a single, consistent snapshot. <mark>The tape, indices, gainers and losers, heatmap, and share view now all come from the same structured data source, which means you are looking at one coherent picture of the market instead of a mix of ad hoc summaries</mark>. The backend reads from a dedicated research file, falls back gracefully if needed, and the frontend is wired to load quickly so you can scan what moved today and which categories are interesting without waiting or second guessing what each number represents.      </p>
      <p>
        Insights and Guides are now backed by a proper content library rather than scattered posts. Version 0.8.5 introduces a single source for insight articles and hooks it up to an alerts file that powers price alerts and pattern based notifications. That means write ups, explanations, and alerts all come from one place, stay up to date together, and can be linked to directly from other parts of PriceCheck. <mark>When you follow an alert or click into an insight, you land on a stable page that matches what you saw in the UI instead of a one off note.</mark>      </p>
      <p>
        The Dashboard gets the largest functional boost in this release. When you paste a link or type an ID, it now locks onto the exact model and aligns that same product across Amazon, Target, Walmart, and Best Buy, which cuts out lookalikes and bundle noise. Titles are cleaned so the brand appears once and the model is clear, Coverage Snapshot weights each store by how competitive its current price is, and variants live in a simple dropdown so you can flip between colors or capacities without leaving the page. The cross store view lets you open either the captured listing or the main product page, the PriceMatch helper generates a ready to send message with the right IDs and links, and behind the scenes the Observation Log and Overview card track how many products and price events were processed recently so you know the data you see is current.      </p>
      <p>
        The extension ties everything together in day to day use. <mark>In 0.8.5 it sends cleaner product identifiers from Amazon, Target, Walmart, and Best Buy into the Dashboard so the first comparison you see is far more likely to be the correct match on the first try</mark>. While you shop, the panel opens quickly, shows the latest comparison, and gives you a direct path to the best working link or a full Dashboard view when you want more detail. If you are new to PriceCheck, install the extension and drop any product link into the Dashboard to see how 0.8.5 behaves. If you already use it, try it on a product you care about and you should notice that the match quality, the live data, and the overall flow are sharper than before.
