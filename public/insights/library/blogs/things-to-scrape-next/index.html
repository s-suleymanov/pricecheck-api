      <h1>What Products are Available?</h1>
      <p class="muted">By Samir Suleymanov • Human-Written</p>
      <p>It has been a long time since I wrote a blog post. I've been working hard to scrape as much data as possible across various categories. Here are some of the most popular products that we have scrapped.</p>
      <p>Firstly, we have scrapped almost every Apple product including the iPhone, iPad, iMac and iWatch. Another store that we have scrapped (almost) entirely is DJI, a popular drone manufacturer. However, many of DJI's products are unavailable due to tariffs which prevents them from being scraped. We have also scrapped a large chunk of Dell laptops including the Inspiron series, Latitude/Precision and XPS. The final store that we have scrapped as of December 21, 2025 is Segway which is a major escooter company. Currenly, all escooters are available in our dataset and we are working very hard to scrape accessories and Segway non-scooter products!</p>
      <p>The future looks very bright for PriceCheck as we continue to expand our offerings and selection of stores. We have already started to scrape Samsung, LG, and Sony. We are planning to scrape more products from the technology category including JBL, Beats, MSI, ASUS, Lenovo, Bambu Lab, Logitech, and Dyson. Additionally, we will expand our offerings in legacy categories including Amazon, Target, Walmart and Best Buy. We are also researching ways to expand our offerings to Costco, Aldi, and CVS with an emphasis on technology hardware products.</p>
      <p>The reason we are focusing so heavily on technology products is because they are the most stable and predictable in terms of pricing and availability. Products like toys, clothes and consumer discretionary have more variations and varieties, and we will begin scraping them in early January (assuming we encounter no issues). Thank you for using PriceCheck at this early stage, and I hope you are as excited about what we are building as I am. Happy holidays!</p>
